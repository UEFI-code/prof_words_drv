# 👨‍🏫 Prof Words Driver 🔥

This driver is splited from [Linux-Danger](https://github.com/UEFI-code/Linux-Danger)

But don't install this driver on Linux-Danger, since Linux-Danger already integrated this feature in its easy_sched😎

> **"Your math is too poor!"** - Every professor, everywhere 🤓

A **LEGENDARY** Linux Kernel Module that brings your professor's eternal wisdom (and eternal nagging) directly into your terminal! 🚀✨

## 🎭 What is this madness?

Remember those **TRAUMATIC** days when your professor would look at your code and say:
- *"This is not scientific research!"* 🔬❌
- *"Your math is too poor!"* 📐😭  
- *"You are running blind code!"* 👨‍💻🙈
- *"Without the formula, it's meaningless!"* 📊💀

Well, **NOW YOUR KERNEL DOES THE SAME THING!** 🎉💀

## 🛠️ Build This Beast

```bash
# Get ready for some HARDCORE kernel hacking! 💪
apt install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) -y
make
```

## 🚀 Unleash the Professor!

```bash
make install
```

**BOOM!** 💥 That's it! Your system is now **POSSESSED** by the spirit of every math professor who ever lived! 👻📚

### 🔥 What happens next?

- Every **30 seconds**, the kernel picks a random process 🎯
- If it's a "heavily loaded" task, it gets **ROASTED** in its own terminal! 🔥
- If it's a daemon, it gets **BROADCASTED** to **ALL TERMINALS**! 📢💀
- Watch your screen fill with colorful professor wisdom! 🌈👨‍🏫

**Example output:**
```
⚠️ Warning from Prof with python3(PID=253): Go back and study linear algebra!
🔴 Prof was ANGRY with systemd(PID=1): Without the formula, it's meaningless!
```

## 🎨 Features That Will Blow Your Mind

- 🌈 **Colorful terminal output** with ANSI escape codes
- 📅 **Day-aware greetings** - because professors care about time
- 🎯 **Process-specific targeting** - no process is safe!
- 📡 **Multi-terminal broadcasting** for maximum embarrassment
- 🌐 **Supports all terminals, including SSH** - Remote terminals are not safe from the professor!
- ⚡ **Lightning-fast kernel-level integration**

## 🛑 Stop the Madness

```bash
make uninstall
```

*When you've had enough of the professor's wisdom...* 😅

## 🌟 Author's Epic Quote

> *"From Beijing to Hiroshima, Professors kept saying the same thing: 'Your math is too poor!' But every time they said it, I had already deleted their math-heavy bullshit, and the system still ran — faster, cleaner, simpler."*
